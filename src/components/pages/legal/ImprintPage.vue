      Liability for contents All contents of our website have been created with
      the utmost care and to the best of our knowledge. However, we cannot
      guarantee the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the content. As a
      service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in
      accordance with § 7 paragraph 1 TMG under the general laws. According to
      §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated as a service provider to
      monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
      circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or
      block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected.
      However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time
      at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become
      aware of the above-mentioned infringements, we will remove this content
      immediately. Limitation of liability for external links Our website
      contains links to external websites of third parties. We have no influence
      on the content of these directly or indirectly linked websites. Therefore,
      we cannot guarantee the correctness of the contents of the "external
      links". The respective providers or operators (authors) of the sites are
      responsible for the contents of the external links. The external links
      were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking and were
      free of illegal content at the time of linking. A constant review of the
      contents of the external links is not possible without concrete evidence
      of a violation of the law. In the case of direct or indirect links to the
      websites of third parties that lie outside our sphere of responsibility, a
      liability obligation would only exist in the case where we become aware of
      the content and it would be technically possible and reasonable for us to
      prevent use in the case of illegal content. This disclaimer also applies
      to links and references within our own website "Name of your domain" from
      questioners, bloggers, guests of the discussion forum. For illegal,
      incorrect or incomplete contents and in particular for damage, which
      develops from the use or disuse of such presented information, alone the
      service provider of the side, to which one referred, is responsible in
      particular that, which refers over left to the respective publication
      only. If we become aware of any legal violations, we will remove the
      external links immediately.
